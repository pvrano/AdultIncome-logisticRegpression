# Adult Income Logistic Regression Project

This project is an initiative to learn and apply machine learning algorithms and concepts commonly used in data science. Using a public dataset from Kaggle containing features such as salary ranges, job types, nationality, gender, age, and other demographic factors, the project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per annum.

## Key Steps

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  The `pandas` library was used extensively for data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify important features.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Data was cleaned and transformed, including handling missing values and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

- **Predictive Analysis:**  
  The logistic regression algorithm was implemented to perform predictive analysis, estimating the probability of an individual's income being above or below $50,000 per year.

- **Visualization:**  
  Results and insights were visualized using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` libraries.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for logistic regression)
- seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)
