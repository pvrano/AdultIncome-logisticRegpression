This project is my initiative towards learning machine learnings algorithms and concepts that are widely used in data science. I have picked up a public dataset from kaggle containing salary ranges, job types, nationality, gender, age and other factors that contribute to making
future desicions about the demographic.
So I used this dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and data cleaning via pandas library in python.
Once cleaned and split properly using one hot encoding, I applied the logistic regression algorithm to find out the future possibility of people's salary ranging either above or below 50,000 USD per annum. 
Later on I used seaborn and matplot libraries to create visualiation to show my results.
